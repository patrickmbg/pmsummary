Description: There are 5 different functions of base R (and utils) combined in this package.  
    Boxplot: Produce box-and-whisker plot(s) of the given (grouped) values.  
    Hist: The generic function hist computes a histogram of the given data values.  
    Summary: summary is a generic function used to produce result summaries of the 
    results of various model fitting functions. The function invokes particular methods 
    which depend on the class of the first argument.  
    Quantile: The generic function quantile produces sample quantiles corresponding to 
    the given probabilities. The smallest observation corresponds to a probability of 0 
    and the largest to a probability of 1.  
    Head: Returns the first or last parts of a vector, matrix, table, data frame or function. 
    Since head() and tail() are generic functions, they may also have been extended to other 
    classes.
